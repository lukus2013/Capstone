## About the Users

This App was built with the intention for the user to see how they perform in their games when they start drinking. We all like to have fun, but when does the fun stop being fun and your game starts to slip? Well now the user can track that with this app. The user can track when they started drinking and how many they had during the game. Notes can also be added to the game specifically in order for the user to make mental notes aboutwhat they remembered from the games they played.

## Features:
# CRUD:

 - The User has the ability to create, read, update, and delete the games they have created and played.
